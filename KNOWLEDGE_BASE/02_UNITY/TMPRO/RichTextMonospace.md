# Monospacing

You can override a font's character spacing and turn it into a monospace font with the `<mspace>` tag. This gives all characters the same amount of horizontal space.

You can specify the character width in pixels or font units.

The `</mspace>` closing tag clears all monospace overrides.

**Example:**

```
Any font can become <mspace=2.75em>monospace, if you really want it.
```
